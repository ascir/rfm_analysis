# rfm_analysis
Python code for analysing customer behaviour based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value.

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. It is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups.

RFM Score Calculations
* RECENCY (R): Days since last purchase
* FREQUENCY (F): Total number of purchases
* MONETARY VALUE (M): Total money this customer spent


A score is calculated based on these 3 parameters and the customers are judged based on their respective scores.

Each segment of customers is aptly dealt with, 

For example:

**Best Customers - Champions**: Reward them. They can be early adopters to new products. Suggest them "Refer a friend".

**At Risk**: Send them personalized emails to encourage them to shop.
